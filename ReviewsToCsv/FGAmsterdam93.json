Have had it on my list for a while so finally made my way and honestly, I would have had a much better breakfast at home than here. When I first walked in, the atmosphere was odd. No music and felt very clinical. Second, the coffee was not good. I ordered a latte and the espresso tasted weak. Could only really taste the milk. The biggest disappointment though was the food and the service. The menu had so many options but I was drawn to the Yosma because I love hummus and pilaki (beans) so much. I added two eggs and when the dish arrived it was so lacklustre. I started digging in and noticed there weren’t any beans. When I mentioned it to the server, she simply said “oh, we must be out.” Frustrating because I would have just ordered something else. She disappeared and then came back to confirm that yes, they were in fact out of beans. I told her it would have been nice to know as I would have ordered something else and she just stared at me and said “oh, sorry.” Then to top it off, when the bill arrived, there was no compensation for the missing item even though I had added two additional items. It was just a really dull experience for a place that has so much hype. Maybe if I had ordered something else, it would have out shined the incredibly mediocre service but you would hope that all dishes on the menu would be a excellent choice and leave you feeling happy with your decision.","ratingValue":1,"replyByOpenAi":true,"reviewReply":"Hey T, we're genuinely sorry to hear about your disappointing experience at FACTORY GIRL.

Unfortunately, the menu on site wasn't as extensive as online and I had a hard time finding something to eat.

I was lucky with one, although I don't quite understand why it wasn't just on the menu. The food itself was very good, but the prices were relatively high.

Bei einem hatte ich dann doch noch Glück, wobei ich nicht ganz verstehe wieso es nicht einfach auch auf der Karte stand. Das Essen selbst war sehr gut, Preise jedoch recht hoch im Verhältnis. Da habe ich in Amsterdam schon bessere Preis-Leistungs-Erfahrungen gehabt.

Lineup, to be expected. Less than 30 minutes later we were seated at a shared table on the beautiful street patio with a delicious Oat Milk Latte in hand. 15 minutes later our meals arrived. We shared the Vegan Shakshuka and the Vegan Tofu Scramble. Both meals came with toasted sour dough bread and a little fresh herb and sprout salad. The Shakshuka was very good! The Scramble on the other hand was very bland, no 'eggy' kala namak taste or the spices you'd expect in a tofu scramble. and was probably not worth the price. but you know, Amsterdam Rent!\n\nOverall the service was surprisingly quick for a summer Sunday afternoon, but I think we got lucky..

This place advertises themselves with vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free dishes, so  they should actually have them in stock when people get there. As a vegetarian I had no issue choosing porched eggs, however my vegan company had a harder time finding something suitable.\nThe pancakes were fine, the strawberry-matcha iced latte & iced chai-latte were delicious!\nPrices are high, which is the standard for restaurants & cafés in Amsterdam.\nThe toilets were clean.","ratingValue":4,"replyByOpenAi":true,"reviewReply":"Hi Anxaro, thanks for your feedback and for visiting Factory Girl in Amsterdam!

Factory Girl is definitely one of the very few spots to get a good meal when out early. While they started as a vegetarian restaurant, meat has been added to the menu, which I find a bit upsetting, but I guess we live in a capitalist world.\n\nI have been here about 5 times ever since they opened, and have seen the menu change a few times (with vegan options becoming more scarce). The service can be quite slow, and it's usually pretty busy in the weekends. I'd recommend coming here early and be ready to wait, especially if you're here with a group. Fret not, the wait is worth it!\n\nThe portion sizes are large, and the items are quite filing. It is a bit on the pricier side, but I'd say it's comparable to other restaurants in the De Pijp neighborhood.\n\nThe buns are amazing, and both the Turk's Mom & Dad breafkasts are quite well balanced.

I mean, they didn't dump food on me, but while I tried to get out of the server's way so she could place plates, I dropped some baked good crumbs on my lap and she rolled her eyes before dumping the plate and disappearing for 15 minutes. Look, I know it is the Netherlands. I know it is Amsterdam. I don't expect \"nice\" or \"kind\" anywhere in Amsterdam. But for breakfast at the price of some of Amsterdam's higher end vegan dinner restaurants, I do expect just a little respect and present staff that I do not have to stand up to ask for more drinks.\n\nAtmosphere: too many tables crammed into a small space with no real ambiance. Felt like a tiny school cafeteria with uncomfortable chairs and semi clean tables.\n\nFood: the pancakes were good but not great. However, the Turk's Dad breakfast was AMAZING. All four of us loved it and really see the potential in FACTORY GIRL. Unfortunately, more than half their online menu is NOT served at the Amsterdam location, so our vegan options went from each person in the party getting a different meal to us just splitting the only two vegan dishes they had. We almost walked out to go somewhere else, but we had another appointment we could not miss and we were hungry. It is sad because we all liked our food and this could have been a 4-5 star experience easily.","ratingValue":3,"replyByOpenAi":true,"reviewReply":"Dear Revan Kon, we are truly sorry to hear about your less than satisfactory experience at our Amsterdam location.

An absolutely delightful dining experience that I have had, twice actually, both for lunches!\n\nFactory Girl is tucked away within the quiet corners of De Pijp, and a short meander from the metro station. We were always swiftly attended to, from the moment we stepped foot inside, until the moment we waltzed outside. So needless to say, we always loved the service. Everyone was warm and personal, asking us if our meal was alright and whether we needed anything else.\n\nThe food was always amazing and timely prepared! A caveat, i have an eye for choosing good items on a menu so usually, i tend to end up with delicious choices. This is something that I have learnt over the years... I personally recommend Turk's mom and their Asian noodles, both are delightfully delicious. They also have a good variety of vegetarian and vegan dishes, just enough to allow considerable choices AND to ensure delectable quality in their dishes. Furthermore, the prices are good for the quality and portion, which is relatively generous!\n\nThe atmosphere lends itself to a hippy, alternative, with a rustic touch, vibe. Definitely more attractive to the younger population, and also a more international clientele.\n\nOverall, everything was great and we had nothing to complain about. Food is delectable, just enough so we are just about full while our wallets stay happy. Service was warm and sweet. Atmosphere was great. 10/10!!

Juices are super small, while still being priced on the high end.

Add at least an additional 3€ if you want something else).\n\nAnd what’s more shocking is the fact that they recently decided to give you the receipt with an extra 10% (!!!!) tip already included BY DEFAULT! And the waiter politely says “there’s a tip included, but you can of course remove it” like what on Earth???  Why don’t you just allow for the client to decide on the tip? Why do you add it already? This is completely pressuring the clients onto giving tips while the service is just standard and nothing special is being done.\n\nAre we heading the US tipping way with this?? Wages in The NL are fair, business should not pressure clients into subsidising their employees. I will leave a tip (which I usually do) out of my own will if I felt comfortable, but forcing me like this feels abusive and rubs clients the wrong way.\n\nNot ever coming back.","ratingValue":2,"replyByOpenAi":true,"reviewReply":"Hi Maria, we're genuinely sorry to hear about your less-than-satisfactory experience at FACTORY GIRL.

Their cinnamon buns are spectacular and we have never had a bad meal. This was my first time at the Amsterdam location, which I visited with several friends for brunch. We ordered a lot of food, and it was, of course, fantastic. Not cheap, but we felt worth the price. It wasn't until later that we realized the receipt included a line with what seems to be an \"optional\" 10% service charge (despite also having a line that a service charge was not included - which is clearly misleading at best). We were not informed of this and didn't realize it in the moment, so ended up adding a tip that brought the total tip to over 20% of the bill. This is the kind of sneaky tactic I would expect from a restaurant in the U.S., but it's completely out of line for a European restaurant. This has left a bitter taste in my mouth and I'm hesitant to return. If you need to raise your prices, raise them. But don't add a service charge and then not tell your customers.

Unfortunately, the taste qualities did not quite live up to the high expectations raised by the appealing photos. It was satisfactory, but definitely could have been better.\n\nThere were also small criticisms regarding the service. We had to ask for tap water even though this was served as standard at other tables. In addition, the additional fried potatoes that were ordered were served too early. Unfortunately, a deviation of around 10 minutes from the rest of the order left her cold. A warm treat would have been definitely desirable here.\n\nAnother point of criticism was the bill. An automatic calculation of 10% tip was included in our bill. Although we were given the option to delete this, we were unable to react quickly to the situation and ended up paying the 10%. However, the quality of the service did not live up to this additional fee.\n\nIn conclusion, I can say that these are of course criticisms at a high level, but Factory Girl also offers prizes where this criticism is justified.\n\n(Original)\nDie optische Präsentation des Frühstücks ließ viel erwarten. Leider konnten die geschmacklichen Qualitäten den hohen Erwartungen, die durch die ansprechenden Fotos geweckt wurden, nicht ganz gerecht werden. Es war zufriedenstellend, aber hätte definitiv besser sein können.\n\nIn Bezug auf den Service gab es ebenfalls kleine Kritikpunkte. Wir mussten um Leitungswasser bitten, obwohl dieses an anderen Tischen standardmäßig serviert wurde. Darüber hinaus wurden die zusätzlich bestellten Bratkartoffeln zu früh serviert. Eine Abweichung von rund 10 Minuten zur restlichen Bestellung ließ sie leider erkalten. Ein warmer Genuss wäre hier durchaus wünschenswert gewesen.\n\nEin weiterer Kritikpunkt war die Rechnung. Eine automatische Berechnung von 10% Trinkgeld war in unserer Rechnung eingefügt. Uns wurde zwar freigestellt dieses zu streichen, in der Situation haben wir allerdings nicht so schnell reagieren können und die 10% schließlich bezahlt. Die Qualität des Services wurde dieser zusätzlichen Gebühr allerdings nicht gerecht.\n\nAbschließend kann ich sagen, dass dies natürlich Kritikpunkte auf hohem Niveau sind, von Factory Girl werden allerdings auch Preise aufgerufen, bei denen diese Kritik gerechtfertigt ist.","ratingValue":3,"replyByOpenAi":true,"reviewReply":"Liebe Mandana Feldmann, vielen Dank, dass du dir die Zeit genommen hast, eine Bewertung für das Factory Girl abzugeben.

But unfortunately when we left we were not thinking about the good food but about why it was so expensive for what we got and why they have this awkward thing going on when paying the bill. The vegan bowl of shakshuka was 20€, which seems very unnecessary for what it was.. And then when paying, their ‘system’ automatically adds a 10% tip to the bill (which is not a thing in the Netherlands) and then the waitress had to explain what the total price actually was without the tip and what it was with tip but that you could still just pay the price without tip or pay less tip. This just seems very cumbersome and time consuming (mostly for the staff having to explain this all the time) and changes the whole experience of having been there. Automatic tipping is not a thing in the Netherlands, customers decide for themselves if they want to tip or not, so just change your system, it will be nicer for everyone.","ratingValue":3,"replyByOpenAi":true,"reviewReply":"Dear Daniëlle Smit, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us.

The menu differs from the one you see online, doesn’t have granola and has a bit of an odd set of vegan breakfast choices in my opinion, leaning much more toward brunch or lunch. You view the menu on your phone and everyone I saw being served needed to be shown where to find the food on it as it’s not the easiest to navigate. We had pancakes that were quite dry. Finally the bill comes with service included and you are asked if you would like to remove it, which I do not appreciate. 2xpancakes + 2xsmoothie was over €56 with tip included.

It is a bit of a trek from the centre, but it was well worth it. I hadn't really picked up that it was a middle eastern/persian themed restaurant until we got there. The menu is more extensive than you can see online. I had a \"big nana borek\". Honestly I don't even know exactly what it was - fillo pastry with filling and vegan feta, vegan yogurt, nuts, olive tapenade... I don't even know if it was sweet or savoury haha! But it was an amazing set of flavours. Also had a cinnamon cardamon bum. My husband had the pancakes which had a pear jam and berries and chocolate.

This place is not child-friendly in the sense that it has steps towards the back (yes, my child did explore it), and has no baby-chairs (unless I'm mistaken). But they were extremely sweet and accommodating. It was fairly busy, and they didn't seem bothered at all that my child sometimes got in their way, which I never take for granted but always hugely appreciate. It takes a lot to be patient with a curious, wandering child when you're a busy waitress/waiter.\n\nAll this blabber and I haven't even gotten to the food yet. It says on their website 'We do not just serve food! We exhibit it, we deliver comfort and bliss.' That's really all I had to affirm in this review. My dish (spinach eggs) was not just a pretentious work of art a la many brunch places that specialise in making you regret not just making brunch at home.

The shakshuka was flavorful, not too spicy and the addition of hummus and harissa is a nice twist. The vegan scramble is also very tasty.

You can get typical stuff like cakes, pancakes and sandwiches but the real breakfasts on the menue are vegetarian or vegan dished you could also have for lunch and dinner. It was very hard to select something becaue everything looks so good and is exotic enough so that you struggle imagine what it might be like. Every plate can be altered with ingredients like extra potatoes, vegetables etc. What you get looks real beautiful and tasted great. Try the Börek!\nWhen we got there on a Friday at 10:15 the place was still empty. When we left at 11:15 it was packed. The guests were mostly beyond university age which might be linked to the quite high prives.

One of them went wrong as you can read below. But Sofia, the founder of the place, contact me and offered me to come back, which I did. It was a really nice time. The food was as good as usual and the service was amazing. It is nice to see a company that values the opinion and experience of their customers. They explained what happen last time and apologised for it. Would recommend going there!\n\nI’ve been there a few times. It was always lovely and delicious until today. We were served by a newbie. Having new employees is normal and good however they should be trained. Asking them to work on a Saturday Morning during rush hour is for sure an awful choice. The girl was lost, did not know what was on the menu and what was not. We had to tell her several times our order and finally she got part of it wrong. She added feta cheese on my eggs, which I did not asked for. I told her afterwards so she was aware of it. We asked to pay. She comes directly with the machine, no bill nothing. We pay and after she asks if we want the bill. We say yes because we want to check we did not pay extra for the feta cheese. She comes back saying that she cannot give us the bill but can show it to us on the Ipad. We realized we were charged EUR 4!!! for something we did not ask for. We ask to be reimbursed. She comes back after a while saying that she cannot reimbursed us but we can order something if we want to. However, we were full and had plans for the day. Therefore, we could not be reimbursed and payed more than what we should. We were punished when we were not the ones doing the mistake. I cannot believe that there is now way to give EUR 4.- back to a customer, either by cash or card. It was a real disappointement.

Upon arrival it seemed like I had to wait a long time for a table, but that was not the case. I was able to join other people on the terrace within 10 minutes. It took a while until my order was taken. The service seemed chaotic and tense (because of the crowds?). It was not even 1pm and some dishes/snacks were already sold out. They didn't even have Jasmine tea anymore. I ended up ordering a Turk's Mom and black tea. The dish tasted good, even though the poached eggs were overcooked.  I think the portion is too small for what you pay. I was still hungry. You can order additional toppings. This costs €3 per topping. I think that if 1 topping were included in the price, the price/portion/quality ratio would be better and only then would I come back here.\n\n(Original)\nAfgelopen zondag hier geweest om te brunchen. Bij aankomst leek het alsof ik lang moest wachten voor een tafel, maar dat was niet het geval. Ik kon binnen 10min aansluiten bij andere mensen op het terras. Het duurde wel even totdat mijn bestelling werd opgenomen. De bediening kwam chaotisch en gespannen over (vanwege de drukte?). Het was nog geen 13u en sommige gerechten/hapjes waren al uitverkocht. Zelfs Jasmijn thee hadden ze niet meer. Uiteindelijk heb ik een Turk’s Mom en zwarte thee besteld. Het gerecht smaakte goed, ondanks dat de gepocheerde eieren te ver gekookt waren.  Ik vind de portie te klein voor wat je betaald. Ik had nog honger. Je kunt toppings bijbestellen. Dit kost 3€ per topping. Ik denk dat als 1 topping bij de prijs inbegrepen zou zijn, dat dan de prijs/portie/kwaliteit verhouding beter zou zijn en dan pas zou ik hier terugkomen.","ratingValue":4,"replyByOpenAi":false,"reviewReply":"Bedankt, Hatice - we zijn zo blij dat je een goede ervaring hebt gehad bij FACTORY GIRL!","reviewReplyType":"notReplied","reviewerTitle":"Hatice","url":null,"thirdPartyReviewSourcesId":69,"locationId":93,"processedByPastReplyJob":false,"replyFetchedByReviewAgent":false,"deleteReplyFailedByReviewAgent":false,"editReplyFailedByReviewAgent":false,"sentimentAnalysis":"Negative","satisfactoryLevel":60,"task":null,"location":{"id":93,"enableReviewAgent":true},"reviewStatus":null,"reviewTags":[]},{"date":"2022-10-12T15:50:26.420Z","google_review_id":"AbFvOql_YEe6t-2z35uz3AvZv5N5PEFK_vcbh6CBn76ZQssW6kEx_FPctA_5X1lsyIOZtWnFef0fbg","id":4486,"isDraft":false,"ratingText":"We had a very good breakfast.

Staff are sophisticated and flexible to arrange you to suitable space depends on your group size\nStaff: friendly and fast, I really like the way they manage guest flow so everyone doesn't have to wait too long to get their order\nFood: impressive and fulfilled in decoration, ingredient. All three dishes we ordered look 90% assemle to the pictures on menu site. The taste could be different from people's goût, to me I prefer less seasoning dishes so the noodle won't be my 'go-to' choice, the remaining ones are stunning. I specifically love the way they toasted the bread, crispy butter fragance, go pretty well with the dishes.\nDrink: my friends ordered tea and cappuchino.

So I found that you lose that customer service/welcoming edge of a venue.\n\nThe wait for this venue was extremely long, Understandable due to it being a busy period of brunch and the current reviews of this venue.\n\nMain dishes of food is over priced for what it is.\nThe food presentation was beautiful however that's as far as it goes, the taste of the food was average at best.\n\nTaking in consideration what I paid, it's not worthy a second visit, I would go as far to say it's not worth a visit in the first place.\n\nVegan pistachio bun was tasty and the coffee was good.\nSo if you are coming here for a coffee and a pistachio bun, then I would give it a try but waiting 1 hour might not make it worth it overall.\n\nVisiting at a quiet time might change my review slightly, however I do not think it would affect my review of the flavor of the food.\n\nMany other places in Amsterdam that should be visited first.","ratingValue":2,"replyByOpenAi":false,"reviewReply":"Hi Ivo, thank you for bringing this to our attention.

We had to wait outside for almost 40 mins even though the waitlist app told us for 20 mins it would be a 1 minute wait. They pack out the restaurant to the point that it’s hard to navigate through. They were understaffed so we had to wait a while to order and then the food took longer than average. I paid €17 for the Turkish breakfast, which although tasty (that’s where the two stars come in) was two poached eggs, a couple of tablespoons of yoghurt and one sliced piece of sourdough. The staff were so busy they basically threw our meals at us and ran back to the kitchen. There were no niceties like “enjoy your meal” or “do you have everything you need?” and when you’re paying as much as you are I think it would be nice to have some sort of friendly customer service. The back area where we were sat, which was right by the open toilets, had no atmosphere and the lighting was terrible.

If this is your business model and you put 30 people and make them wait for more than an hour to get food, you need to tell people BEFORE they sit down that waiting time is so long. Even discount for food can't chance horrible experience. Also I'm sure your waitresses will be more happy seeing smiling and happy clients, rather than apologizing for service.

The cup of coffee was so small that it was gone in 3 sips.

De kop koffie was zo klein dat het met 3 slokken op was. Naast dat hadden wij geen zout en peper op tafel, geen suiker, zelf steeds zoeken of pakken van andere tafels terwijl het terras zowat leeg was en de bediening dit makkelijk op ons tafel had kunnen plaatsen, ook zag zij dat wij alles pakten, maar nog niet de drang voelen om alles op onze tafel plaatsen, zodat we niet alsmaar moesten zoeken.

However, both food and service was quite disappointing. The atmosphere was not very cosy due to staff energy.\n\nWe were seated at a nice round table, though it took a while before we received the menu and to take our drink order. This I usually oversee as I know lunchrooms get very busy.\n\nKale & Eggs\nI could choose the way my eggs would come, and choose scrambled eggs and the kale got replaced by spinach as it was seasonal. I love spinach so that was no problem at all. The scrambled eggs were definitely not scrambled nor the color it should have had (yellow/white). They were rather brown and had a vast substance, more like a dense omelet. The taste combination of the spinach and the eggs was very bland. Unfortunately, it was not the sensation I had hoped for.\n\nThe girl serving us was friendly. However, I went over to the bar and asked for some cutlery as there was a missing pair on the table, and the women seemed bothered with me asking. She did not respond with any words and just walked towards a colleague who'm then helped me getting cutlery.\n\nI was not feeling the place much due to both food and service aspect.

But unfortunately I had one of the worst brunch experiences ever. We got caught in the rain, so called them in advance. Once arrived, they made a mistake with the reservation, which can totally happen. But after 20 mins of waiting to order, we grabbed the menu card ourselves and waited another 10 mins. The waitress was very friendly, but didn't apologize (only much later on) nor give us complimentary drinks. The pancakes, juices and some of the coco anjela were already sold out, so we ordered potatoes & eggs Catalan and sexy and fit eggs. The portions were good, but there were hardly any potatoes and the omelet was very bland. The coco anjela was the highlight. Very disappointing and such a shame that we were unseen by the owner and the staff.\n\nUpdate:\nI have visited Factory Girl again.

We politely told her no but she kept eluding to that in Amsterdam it’s very common to sit in another table with others. We’ve traveled all over the world and we had never been asked to interrupt our time to after we’ve already ordered to accommodate another party. A “no thank you” from your guest should be enough.

In fact, it's that extra level of farm freshness that can allow food its best flavor. My wife and I are pretty hardcore foodies and Factory Girl reminded us of our favorite spots in LA, Austin, San Francisco, etc. It seems we found a hidden gem as many other places showed up on \"best of\" lists but we are convinced that for breakfast and lunch in the dam (there's a Factory Girl in Berlin too), we found the best spot.

The vibe is bright and modern, the food super clean and flavorful, and the service is warm and inviting. Sofia and Erhan are the coolest and they understand that healthy food doesn't have to taste bland - quite the opposite. In fact, it's that extra level of farm freshness that can allow food its best flavor. My wife and I are pretty hardcore foodies and Factory Girl reminded us of our favorite spots in LA, Austin, San Francisco, etc. It seems we found a hidden gem as many other places showed up on \"best of\" lists but we are convinced that for breakfast and lunch in the dam (there's a Factory Girl in Berlin too), we found the best spot. That's why, after trying another place on our second day, we came back to Factory Girl for breakfast again on our third day. So, we know our spot if we ever became locals - meantime our fingers are crossed that they open one in LA some day!","ratingValue":5,"replyByOpenAi":false,"reviewReply":null,"reviewReplyType":"notReplied","reviewerTitle":"Zack I","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d15036461-r737709777-FACTORY_GIRL_Restaurant-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html","thirdPartyReviewSourcesId":57,"locationId":93,"processedByPastReplyJob":false,"replyFetchedByReviewAgent":false,"deleteReplyFailedByReviewAgent":false,"editReplyFailedByReviewAgent":false,"sentimentAnalysis":"Positive","satisfactoryLevel":95,"task":null,"location":{"id":93,"enableReviewAgent":true},"reviewStatus":null,"reviewTags":[]},{"date":"2020-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","google_review_id":null,"id":1748769,"isDraft":false,"ratingText":"siamo stati a fare colazione sia il 30 mattina che il 31,siamo stati veramente bene!!! servizio impeccabile e consiglio a tutti di assaggiare lo speciale coco anjela!!! spettacolare!! grazie ragazzi alla prossima!!","ratingValue":5,"replyByOpenAi":false,"reviewReply":null,"reviewReplyType":"notReplied","reviewerTitle":"massimo","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d15036461-r737632468-FACTORY_GIRL_Restaurant-Amsterdam_North_Holland_Province.html","thirdPartyReviewSourcesId":57,"locationId":93,"processedByPastReplyJob":false,"replyFetchedByReviewAgent":false,"deleteReplyFailedByReviewAgent":false,"editReplyFailedByReviewAgent":false,"sentimentAnalysis":"Positive","satisfactoryLevel":95,"task":null,"location":{"id":93,"enableReviewAgent":true},"reviewStatus":null,"reviewTags":[]},{"date":"2020-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","google_review_id":null,"id":1748770,"isDraft":false,"ratingText":"From the beautiful atmosphere, the mouth-watering meal, and incredibly warm service...

Uber Google sind wir auf das Lokal aufmerksam geworden.\nDas Frühstück war ein Traum, wir hatten das Egg Benedict in einer eigenen Interpretation. Köstlich! Der Cappuccino war wirklich lecker. Die Atmosphäre war entspannt, das Publikumgemisch war gezeichnet von Einheimischen und Touristen. Aber ein sehr entspannter Mix.\nDer Geschäftsführer Seven war sehr sehr nett, zuvorkommend und lernte gerade deutsch wie er uns mitteilte, sodass wir uns auf deutsch mit ihm unterhielten. Er erzählte uns im Wechsel zwischen Berlin und Amsterdam zu arbeiten. Alles in allem war es sehr authentisch, wirklich köstlich, auch wenn sich das natürlich im Preis wiederspiegelt, was wir aber gerne bereit sind für gutes Essen zu bezahlen! Zum Schluss hatten wir noch die Gelegenheit das wirklich leckere Coco Anjela zu probieren.

We love breakfast and have our own special ways of serving it. For us, breakfast can never be only a slice of bread with a piece of cheese or ham. Breakfast is the most important meal in our town and needs special effort and love.\nI’m so glad to have found a place that finally ended my cravings of a really good breakfast, where eggs are more than just eggs and a sandwich is more than just a sandwich.\nFactory Girl did a great job. They cook with their heart and soul. They love their job which is obvious. I loved the names of the dishes. Even that shows how much thought they’ve put into every single dish. Eggs never tasted this good!\nThe flavors are to die for.

I visit here regularly since it’s open in De Pijp. It mostly known by locals and cool cats in Amsterdam 😎 It’s not a classic touristic breakfast restaurant around the district. Its located in very cool and quiet street in De Pijp. As though they have specificly picked this spot just to be discovered by cool locals. They serve only breakfast, healthy lunch and of course special healthy dessert Coco Anjela. Don’t leave before you try Coco Anjela!
